#Davaleba 1:
#You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

#Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

#Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.


#def positive_sum(arr):
#    sum = 0
#    for e in arr:
#        if e > 0:
#            sum = sum + e
#    return sum


#Davaleba 2:

#Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

#For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 

#For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 


#def square_sum(numbers):
#    return sum(x ** 2 for x in numbers)



#Davaleba 3:

#Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.


#def doubleInteger(i):
#   return i * 2
